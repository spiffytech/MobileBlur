MobileBlur is a mobile-friendly interface to your Newsblur RSS feeds. It's written in Python with the web2py framework. 

It's easy to deploy on your own- just clone the repo and run:

    python web2py.py

Thats is it!

MobileBlur works hard to be secure for random users to use- it doesn't store anything on the server that can be used to log users in when they're not actively using the site. MobileBlur passes Newsblur's own authentication cookie to the user, and retrieves it whenever the user does something on MobileBlur.
